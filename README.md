# vantemp.js

vantemp.js is a template engine with the following features

 * No new syntax, just plain html and JavaScript with 4 special symbols
 * Since it's vanilla js, you have the power how much view/logic you include in your templates
 * You are not limited by the engine's capabilities (again because of vanilla js)
 * Super fast template building on client
 * Reusable templates with parameters
 * Client and server side. (Milestones include rendering first page on the server, subsequent views rendered on the client, like meteor)
 
Extras

 * Extendable compile engine through plugins, for example: Define your styles in your templates. (no more switching between .html and .css and looking for that damn class)
 * The source of the whole engine is less than 10kb. You can't dive deep here (what makes it easy to change everything)
 
*Definitely check out the examples to see it's beauty in action*
